# bean-add - A beancount transaction entry assistant

A simple tool to ease adding transactions to your beancount [http://furius.ca/beancount/] journal, featuring much-needed tab completion for account names and descriptions.

To use it, just run 'bean-add {FILENAME}'. Your journal file will be parsed, any account names and description strings will added to the completion list.

Follow the instructions. The journal file will be appended every time you finish inputting a transaction.

Please note that there is no input validation. You are encouraged to run 'bean-check' as soon as you are done inputting the transactions and correct any errors by hand.
